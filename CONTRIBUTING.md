  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and types
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Add E2E tests for user-facing features

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Update README for new features
- Add examples for new functionality
