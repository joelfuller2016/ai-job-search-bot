### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs from external sources
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

#### Dependencies
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to secure versions
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Use secure base images and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret management solutions
- **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## Known Security Considerations

### Job Site Automation
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect job site rate limits to avoid being blocked

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports promptly
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit researchers (with permission) for their findings
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure

### Researcher Guidelines

- **Good Faith**: Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations and service disruption
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Allow reasonable time for patching before public disclosure
- **Scope**: Focus on security issues, not general bugs or feature requests
- **No Exploitation**: Don't access, modify, or delete data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **HTTPS**: All communications over encrypted channels
